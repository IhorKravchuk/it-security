* Exceptions and Limits:
    * Note: Elastic Load Balancing logs requests sent to the load balancer, including requests that never made it to the back-end instances
â€‹
    * Limits: Elastic Load Balancing logs requests on a best-effort basis. We recommend that you use access logs to understand the nature of the requests, not as a complete accounting of all requests.
* Log record/file format:
    * Each log entry contains the details of a single request made to the load balancer. All fields in the log entry are delimited by spaces.

    * Web Distribution Log File Format
RTMP Distribution Log File Format
Each entry in a log file gives details about a single user request. The log files for web and for RTMP distributions are not identical, but they share the following characteristics:
Use the W3C extended log file format. (For more information, go to http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-logfile.html.)
Contain tab-separated values.
Contain records that are not necessarily in chronological order.
Contain two header lines: one with the file-format version, and another that lists the W3C fields included in each record.
Substitute URL-encoded equivalents for spaces and non-standard characters in field values.
